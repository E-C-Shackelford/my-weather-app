# my-weather-app

Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and integrating a live API, I created a weather app project designed for desktops as my final project in my SheCodes Plus - Front-End Development certification.
My desktop weather app allows users to search a city and receive current data regarding the date, time, weather condition, wind speed, temperature, weather for the next three hours, and weather for the next four days.
My desktop weather app allows users to switch bewteen celsius and fahrenheit for the current temperature, and they are also given the high and low temperatures when looking at the weather for the next three hours and the next four days.
Weather icons are also used to communicate the current, hourly and daily weather conditions.
